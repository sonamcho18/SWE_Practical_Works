# Exerxise 1
This code repeats through the tree to find the rightmost node, which holds the maximum value in a BST.

# Exercise 2
This function repeatedly counts all nodes in the left and right subtrees and adds one for the current node, providing the total count.

# Exercise 3
This function uses a sequence to perform a level-order crossing, visiting nodes level by level from left to right.

# Exercise 4
This function calculates the height of the tree by finding the maximum height between the left and right subtrees and adding one for the current node.

# Exercise 5
This function checks whether each node satisfies the BST properties by ensuring that each node's value is within the valid range defined by its lineage.
