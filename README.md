# Exercise 1
Splits the expression into tokens, pushes numbers onto the stack, and performs operations when encountering operators.
Final result is the last element on the stack.

# Exercise 2
Since stacks follow Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) order and queues follow First-In-First-Out (FIFO) order

# Exercise 3
Uses a deque to implement a basic task coordinator.
Tasks are added to the end of the queue and processed from the front, ensuring FIFO order.
When there are no tasks left, it prints "No tasks to process".

# Exercise 4
Processes each task in the order they were added.
When there are no tasks left, it prints "No tasks to process".
